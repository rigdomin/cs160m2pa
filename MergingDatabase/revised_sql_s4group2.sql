The complement of metabolites in a biological system is known as the metabolome and represents the downstream effect of an organismâs genome and its interaction with the environment. Metabolomics has a wide application area across the medical and biological sciences and is attractive to both new and established scientists. In this course we will provide an introduction to metabolomics, explain why we want to study the metabolome and describe the current challenges in analysing the complement of metabolites in a biological system. We will describe the interdisciplinary approaches adopted in the metabolomics workflow and demonstrate how the combined efforts of scientistâs from different disciplines is advancing this exciting field.

Scale really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way youve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques youll need to do so.The techniques youll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others.

One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 16th century. This course in architectural history is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural "moments." How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. Material covered in lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture.

Have you ever thought about the possibility of life elsewhere in the Universe? For the first time in human history, we know that planets around other stars not only exist, but are common! Alien Worlds focuses on the search and characterization of planets orbiting other stars (called extrasolar planets or âexoplanetsâ). Over the course of nine modules, we will learn some of the techniques used to discover the thousands of known exoplanets and will discuss how we can use basic scientific tools to characterize the sizes, masses, compositions, and atmospheres of exoplanets. We will also learn about the diversity of stars in the Galaxy to understand how stellar properties affect exoplanet detection techniques and influence planetary formation and habitability. In addition to the exploration of exoplanets, students in Alien Worlds will gain a basic understanding of light, gravity and motion, and be introduced to some of the most extreme life on planet Earth. We will hear from experts at the forefront of exoplanet science and interact with other participants and instructors through social media and online tools. Students will leave Alien Worlds with a better understanding of their place in the Universe and the skills to comprehend the wealth of new discoveries surrounding the countless worlds around distant stars.

Nearly all of our theories about promoting progress come from how we interpret the economic changes of the last 500 years. This past decadeâs crises continue to remind us just how much capitalism changes, even as its basic featuresâwage labor, financial markets, private property, entrepreneursâendure. While capitalism has a global history, the United States plays a special role in that story. This course will help you to understand how the United States became the worldâs leading economic power, revealing essential lessons about what has been and what will be possible in capitalismâs on-going revolution. Do I need to have taken economics before? No. Though there will be discussion of economic ideas, professors will assume no prior economic training. I am not familiar with American history, but I am interested in how capitalism works. Can I take this course? Yes. We will have relevant links to helpful background material for each section that should make it possible for those with no knowledge of U.S. history to take the class. Is this class about economic thought like Smith, Marx, Ricardo, Hayek, etc.? This class is primarily about what actually happened rather than theories of what happened. While we will touch on important economic thinkers, this class will focus more on the people and institutions that developed capitalism in the United States. If you want to know how capitalism works and came about, this is the class for you. Will certificates be awarded? Yes. If you complete the work and achieve a passing grade in the course, you can earn a Honor Code Certificate, which indicates that you have completed the course successfully. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of CornellX, designating the institution from which the course originated. What will help me complete this course? We have found that the best help you can get is other people in the real world. Enlist friends, co-workers, family, and other people to take the class with you. Ask your friends on Facebook or Twitter. Arrange a time during a lunch break or an evening to discuss the weekâs videos and readings. Think of this âMOOC clubâ like a book club! You will get more out of the material and be much more likely to finish. I want to read more about American Capitalism! Professors Baptist and Hyman just wrote a course reader expressly for this MOOC (though it is also being taught at Cornell University). Containing every reading from the MOOC, as well as additional readings from leading scholars (that could not be had for free!), this course reader provides the student with more background for every topic. Each reading is introduced and discussed by the professors. Each reading, as well, has additional questions for the student to discuss with their friends. Are there prerequisites? This course is designed to be accessible for people without a strong background in U.S. history. Nevertheless, we make reference to many people, locations, events, or developments that may be unfamiliar to some students. Below are sources for additional information. Wikipedia is a very helpful source for a quick definition or description of most of the material in this course. It can help you answer most factual questions you might have. Digital HistoryÂ is a website that can serve as an online text book if you need a stronger grounding in U.S. history. For more difficult questions, you can post a question on the discussion board where your fellow students may be able to help you.

Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in todayâs world. This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well. At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring. Thanks to the wonderful feedback of last yearâs students, the course has been further improved. Follow us on Twitter @CRMooc for updates and hints about the course. FAQs What is the estimated effort for course? About 6 hrs/week. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing! The course is free. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. Will certificates be awarded? Yes. Online learners who achieve a passing grade in a course can earn a certificate of achievement. These certificates will indicate you have successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of DelftX, designating the institution from which the course originated. Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.

From simulating complex phenomenon on supercomputers to storing the coordinates needed in modern 3D printing, data is a huge and growing part of our world. A major tool to manipulate and study this data is linear algebra.Â This course is part 1 of a 2-part course. Â In this part, weâll learn basics of matrix algebra with an emphasis on application. Â This class has a focus on computer graphics while also containing examples in data mining. Weâll learn to make an image transparent, fade from one image to another, and rotate a 3D wireframe model. Â Weâll also mine data; for example, we will find similar movies that one might enjoy seeing. In the topic of sports ranking, weâll be ready to participate in March Madness and submit our own mathematically generated brackets to compete against millions of others.Â  The lectures are developed to encourage you to explore and create your own ideas either through your own programming but also with online tools developed for the course.Â  Come to this course ready to investigate your own ideas.

All features and materials may not be all available. Check back often to see when new course start dates are announced.  In recent years, flying robots such as miniature helicopters or quadrotors have received a large gain in popularity. Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.Â  In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered: In particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. For the flight experiments, we provide a browser-based quadrotor simulator which requires the students to write small code snippets in Python. This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. This course has been offered by TUM for the first time in summer term 2014 on EdX with more than 20.000 registered students of which 1400 passed examination. The MOOC is based on the previous TUM lecture âVisual Navigation for Flying Robotsâ which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013. FAQ Do I need to buy a textbook? No, all required materials will be provided within the courseware. However, if you are interested, we recommend the following additional materials: Do I need to build/own a quadrotor? No, we provide a web-based quadrotor simulator that will allow you to test your solutions in simulation. However, we took special care that the code you will be writing will be compatible with a real Parrot Ardrone quadrotor. So if you happen to have a Parrot Ardrone quadrotor, we encourage you to try out your solutions for real.

Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether itâs the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isnât bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing oneâs attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life. The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life.Â  By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioral economics and allows learners to develop a hands-on approach by understanding its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to ânudgeâ choice. In three modules, learners will be able to a). explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behavior change, b). learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c). design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions. Understanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to truly use behavioral economics and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioral research. After the first two weeks learning the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions. You will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like âdoes irrationality impact welfare?â or âwhat strategy is better for improving welfare â nudging or education?â If youâve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioral economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you.

Behavioral medicine is the science of changing our behavior, so we as individuals can stay healthy and happy as long as we can. If you choose to join this five-week course on Behavioral Medicine, you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with âvirtual patient scenariosâ will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your life. Weâll start the first week by looking at what makes us motivated to change our behavior. We often feel motivated for change when we experience imbalance in life. One example of a key concept that helps us understand how imbalance arises is the effort-reward model, which states that ill-health is more likely to arise when there is a gap between the effort you make and how you are rewarded. To help people who are experiencing imbalance identify what they need to change, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a âvirtual bartenderâ who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following four weeks will focus on coping with stress (week 2), improving sleep (week 3), increasing physical activity (week 4), and everyday behaviors (week 5) like hand washing, condom use and minimizing risky alcohol use. To complete this course, you will need to set aside about 5-8 hours a week. Youâll use some of this time to watch course videos, answer questions designed to help you reinforce and retain what you have learned, and understand the homework required. The remaining time will be for course reading, mostly open access scientific articles, and solving homework tasks. Youâll be doing part of the work together with other participants in the course community.

How can you understand how a new service is being used, both quantitatively and qualitatively? How can you use all of the rich sensing and I/O capabilities of mobile devices to create experiences that go far beyond what''s possible on a traditional computer? Mobile devices are changing the ways that we interact with each other and information in the world. This course will take you from a domain of interest, through generative research, design, usability, implementation and field evaluation of a novel mobile experience. You''ll finish the course with a working, field-tested application suitable for release in the app store as well as a deep understanding of human interaction with mobile devices and services. Based on a popular MIT class that has been taught since 2006 by Frank Bentley of Yahoo Labs and Ed Barrett, a Senior Lecturer at MIT, this course will explore what makes mobile devices unique. A primary focus will be on studying existing behavior and using key findings for design. While writing the code for an app is a part of the class, the majority of the topics will cover designing and evaluating a unique mobile experience. Along the way, you will have opportunities to share your work with other students from around the world! Java experience (or Objective C for iOS users) and a smartphone are required.

You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative.Â  You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand.

And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions. How does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results.

The function of the brain is to govern behavior, and the aim of this course is to causally link biophysical mechanisms with simple behaviors studied in mice. The brain processes information through the concerted activity of many neurons, which communicate with each other through synapses organised in highly dynamic networks. The first goal of the course is to gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the fundamental building blocks of the mammalian brain, its synapses and neurons. The second goal is to understand neuronal networks, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. The third goal is to place neuronal network function in the context of sensory processing ultimately leading to behavioral decisions and motor output.

How can Iran be stopped from getting a nuclear bombânegotiations, sanctions, or military action? As a participant in this course, you will advise the president in deciding whether, and how, the U.S. should act. Once youâve made your assessment, you will move on to wrestle with other scenarios preoccupying policy makers. Between the Assad regime and ISIS, civilians in Syria and Iraq face unimaginable atrocities. Should the U.S. intervene? Chinaâs rise is rattling capitalist economies and a half-century of Pacific peace. What counterbalancing actions should Washington take? Leaks are a fact of life â but why do they happen? Who gets them, and why? Should journalists publish or withhold them? Does legal accountability lie with the leakerâor the journalist? This six-week course casts you as advisors on the hardest decisions any president has to make. We will go behind the veil to see the dynamic between the press and the U.S. government, to explore these dilemmas. We will also have to contend with the reality that government secrets rarely stay that way. Participants will learn to navigate the political landscape of an era in which private remarks become viral tweets, and mistakes by intelligence agencies become front-page stories. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: Analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.Â  Students will learn to summarize their analyses in a succinctÂ âStrategic Options Memo,â combining careful analysis and strategic imagination with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support. They will also examine how policymaking is affected by constant, public analysis of government deliberations. From this page, you may register to view the content for the Open version of this course.

Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing.Â  We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement.Â  Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes.Â  Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics.Â  This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment: This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX. FAQ What is the format of the class? The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material.Â  Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count. Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can "work ahead" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them. What computer system do I need for the course? The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system. Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.? This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL. Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster. I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course? In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind. I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course? The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.

Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life âÂ agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted. This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.Â  The courseâs instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.

It is an inclusive, general introductory course, combining natural and cultural geography with history and art. Through the lens of humanism and independent thinking, learners will be encouraged to observe and analyze cultural phenomena from spatial and time perspectives. This course has 12 chapters: The basic research method of world cultural geography; The division of world culture areas; The world''s population distribution and migration of population; Origin of agriculture; Diffusion and regional differences; The origin and spread of the city; Regional differences and characteristics of urban morphology; The spatial distribution of the major languages, religions, ethnicities in the world and their relationship; The great geographical discovery and the formation of the world colonial system; World geopolitics and the spatial structures of the world geography system; Global economic integration; Urbanization and its political, economic, social impacts. Using relevant domestic and foreign textbooks, publications, maps, photos, and charts to show the difference and the changing progress of spatial patterns of the cultures, learners will be asked to observe and analyze cultural phenomena with geographic and spatial vision and to consider the development and changing process of the cultural phenomena in light of time sequence. The course will include a midterm and final exam. The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy.

EECS149.1x introduces students to the design and analysis of cyber-physical systems --- computational systems that are integrated with physical processes. Applications of such systems include medical devices and systems, consumer electronics, toys and games, assisted living, traffic control and safety, automotive systems, process control, energy management and conservation, environmental control, aircraft control systems, communications systems, instrumentation, critical infrastructure control (electric power, water resources, and communications systems for example), robotics and distributed robotics (telepresence, telemedicine), defense systems, manufacturing, and smart structures. A major theme of the course is on the interplay of practical design with formal models of systems, including both software components and physical dynamics. A major emphasis will be on building high confidence systems with real-time and concurrent behaviors. Students will apply concepts learned in lectures to programming a robotic controller in a specially-designed virtual laboratory environment with built-in automatic grading and feedback mechanisms.

Capturing and analyzing data has changed how decisions are made and resources are allocated in businesses, journalism, government, and military and intelligence fields. Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence. In education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to asÂ learning analytics. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. Thatâs starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies. The era of data and analytics in learning is just beginning. Data, Analytics, and LearningÂ provides an introduction to learning analytics and how it is being deployed in various contexts in education, including to support automated intervention, to inform instructors, and to promote scientific discovery. Additionally, we will discuss tools and methods, what skills data scientists need in education, and how to protect student privacy and other rights. The course will provide a broad overview of the field, suitable for a broad audience. Learners will explore the logic of analytics, the basics of finding, cleaning, and using educational data, predictive models, text analysis, and activity graphs and social networks. We will discuss use of analytics in data domains such as log files and text data.Â  Tableau Software is partnering with University of Texas Arlington to provide analytics software to course participants as well as technical support and guest lectures. Additional software will be introduced and discussed throughout the course. How this course works: This course will experiment with multiple learning pathways. It has been structured to allow learners to take various pathways through learning content - either in the existing edX format or in a social competency-based and self-directed format. Learners will have access to pathways that support both beginners, and more advanced students, with pointers to additional advanced resources. In addition to interactions within the edX platform, learners will be encouraged to engage in distributed conversations on social media such as blogs and Twitter.

Â  Latin America and the Caribbean region is experiencing a rapid urbanization process that carries risks and opportunities for its integral and sustainable development. How can urban expansion be managed and effectively planned for? How can decent housing be guaranteed for the growing population? As informal settlements in developing cities increase, how does this impact urban planning? How can urban heritage gain value and historic centers be revitalized? This course hopes to provide answers to these questions through theoretical content, videos, hands-on activities, and case studies that will help participants understand the urban context of Latin America and the Caribbean. Likewise, an effort has been made to connect participants and their experiences so that joint solutions can be found for general and specific problems the Region and its cities are facing today. This MOOC is specially targeted at public officials in Latin America and the Caribbean, who work or, directly or indirectly, are involved in urban and housing development. Also, it was thought out for those who, through academic activities or everyday work, are having a greater and deeper contact with these topics and its derivatives. Once registered, you will have the opportunity to participate in an assignment that lets you apply the studied contents as a whole and based on it, and share an urban intervention from your city. The authors of the best work will be invited to present it in Â¡Viva el Centro!-- an event organized by the Inter-American Development Bank .Â  If you have any questions, please contact us atÂ idbx@iadb.org The preparation of this course was financed by the Special Program for Institutional Development (SPID) of the Inter-American Development Bank.

To be effective, educational technologies must be designed based on what we know about how people learn. Through interviews with multiple experts in the field, this course examines educational technologies, outlines the theories that influenced their development, and examines their use. The course leads up to a final project â a kickstarter style pitch for a new educational technology - which is worked on iteratively across the weeks.Â  It involves active weekly participation. In week 1, weâll talk about the history of educational technologies and how they change the way we learn.Â Weâll also discuss two important educational theories that focus on student-centered learning. In week 2, weâll explore what it means to learn something and examine several different approaches to deepen learning. Weâll begin by introducing a specific framework for thinking about learning. Weâll then take a close look at how educational software developers are more deeply engaging learners and even providing feedback to students as they learn. Week 3 will focus on forms of Active Learning, where students choose and pursue activities based on their own interests. Weâll also talk with experts about designing to help build important non-cognitive skills, like persistence and developing mastery. Week 4 will move from individual learning to collaborative learning in a range of forms, from apprenticeships to communities of practice. Weâll speak with experts about the many ways learning in groups can manifest itself. No matter what the medium, collaborative learning has a lot to teach us. Week 5 focuses on assessment. Â All the clever educational technology design in the world isnât very useful if we donât know whether studentsâ learning is being enhanced by it or what changes need to be made to increase its effectiveness.Â Weâll talk with teachers, students, and assessment experts who will provide an overview of the different types of assessment and how technology is changing the field of assessment. Finally, in week 6, weâll talk about design-based research, a methodology for research and design of educational innovations in which you create projects that embody the educational change you wish to study. Week 0 of this course is a ''ramp-up'' week for participants to introduce themselves to one another and become familiar with the forums and other course platform features.

The field of learning games is rapidly growing, with interest from academics, publishers, schools and startups. But what makes a good learning game? Where do ideas come from and how do you create them? These are the questions that this course tries to answer. Â  The premise of learning games from some perspectives seems like a perfect and easy solution - get people to learn things they donât want to by motivating them through game play. To others it seems like an oxymoron - if learning is hard then it canât possibly be fun at the same time. The key to designing good learning games is to reconcile these perspectives by creating games that focus on creating environments based on âhard fun.âÂ This idea will be a central tenet of this course. Â  Through six units comprising nine weeks, we will look at the evolution of educational video games and hear from experts working on many aspects of learning games from design to development to implementation. And we will help you create your own learning game and surrounding curriculum. Â  Weâll kickstart the course with Unit 0, a time to become familiar with the course platform and meet your peers. Unit 1 will start by taking a look at the history of the field to better understand how it has shaped present learning games. In Unit 2, weâll dig in to the current state of the field and address some of the basics of how we learn from games and design games for learning. Â  In Units 3 and 4, weâll start you down the path of developing your own learning games, talking with key practitioners and learning from their processes. Weâll also look at case studies in design and implementation of learning games, as well as some frameworks for design. Â  In Unit 5, weâll look at how to integrate learning games into contemporary classrooms, as well as the relationship between games and assessments. And in Unit 6 weâll explore how the business of learning games is developing, and where things might be headed. Â  In each unit, you will complete assignments that broaden your skill set and provide deep understanding of key ideas. For your culminating project, you will develop a learning game and the curriculum that goes with it. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on building community so that you can get meaningful feedback on your designs, learn from your peers, and even work collaboratively.

Should reading, watching, memorizing facts, and then taking exams be the only way to learn? Or could technology (used effectively) make learning more interactive, collaborative, and constructive? Could learning be more engaging and fun? We construct, access, visualize, and share information and knowledge in very different ways than we did decades ago. The amount and types of information created, shared, and critiqued every day is growing exponentially, and many skills required in todayâs working environment are not taught in formal school systems. In this more complex and highly-connected world, we need new training and competency developmentâwe need to design a new learning environment. The ultimate goal of this project-based course is to promote systematic design thinking that will cause a paradigm shift in the learning environments of today and tomorrow. Participants are not required to have computer programming skills, but must have 1) a commitment to working in a virtual team and 2) the motivation to help people learn better. All of us have been involved in the learning process at some point in our lives; in this course we invite educators, school leaders, researchers, students, parents, entrepreneurs, computer programmers, illustrators, interface designers, and all those who are interested in working together, to create a new learning environment. After the completion of this course, students will be able to: - Identify advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and potentials of at least 10 interactive learning models and solutions. - Describe how online communication, collaboration, and visualization technology play a role in the behavioral, cognitive, constructivist, and social dimensions of learning. - Describe the major components and processes involved in development of interactive education systems. - Communicate rationales of learning technology design approaches through team-oriented collaborations. - Evaluate the value of ideas, principles, and techniques used in educational media or systems. As a Final Team Project, students will design a new learning model catering to 21st century environments and learners. Each self-formed team will design and develop an application or system that combines team interaction activities and learning support features in ways that are effective and appropriate for today''s computing and communication devices. Students must consider potential idiosyncrasies with various learning devices (e.g., tablet, phone, PC), infrastructure requirements (e.g., cellular network, wi-fi, Bluetooth), and any special hypothetical circumstances if relevant.

Technological innovations have revolutionized the way we view and interact with the world around us. Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data? Students will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required). Part 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis.

Â The course begins with a review and extension of the basics of signal processing including a discussion of group delay and minimum-phase systems, and the use of discrete-time (DT) systems for processing of continuous-time (CT)Â signals.Â  The course develops flow-graph and block diagram structures including lattice filtersÂ for implementingÂ DT systems, and techniques for the design of DT filters. Parametric signal modeling and the efficient implementation of DT multirate and sampling rate conversion systems are discussed and developed. An in-depth development of the DFT and its computation as well as its use for spectral analysis and for filtering is presented. This component of the course includes a careful and insightful development of the relationship between the time-dependent Fourier transform and the use of filter banks for both spectral analysis and signal coding. 6.341x is organized around eleven units each typically consisting of a set of two to four topics. The source material for learning each topic includes suggested reading in the course text, clarifying notes, other related reading, and video excerpts and will include an interactive on-line discussion forum. The course text is the widely used text by Oppenheim and Schafer (third edition), available on the course website in viewable format. The video segments are adapted from live video recordings of the MIT residential course.Â  Each topic includes a set of automatically-graded exercises for self-assessment and to help in digesting and understanding the basics of the topic, and in some cases to preview topics. A typical unit in the course concludes with a set of more extensive problems to help in integrating the topics and developing a deeper understanding. Automatic grading of your answers to these problems as well as solutions will be provided. Â  Who can register for this course?

At Acumen, we believe in giving the poor choice not charity. We envision low income people as consumers who can make their own decisions about the products and services needed to improve their lives. At the same time, we want to offer the social entrepreneurs developing new products and services insights about why low income consumers often choose to adopt a new innovation. Why do some new sanitation solutions catch on among poor consumers in Kenya while others never gain traction? Why did one new agricultural product gain momentum in India while others failed? How can you design products and services that are incorporated into the daily lives of your customers?

This is an interactive course about the basic concepts of Systems, Control and their impact in all the human activities. First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements. By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end. Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution. Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field.Â  ', 'https://edx.org/course/dynamics-control-upvalenciax-dc201x', 'http://www.youtube.com/v/oPrKjjrDOdY?version=3&amp;autohide=1', '2015-11-24', 42, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/styles/course_video_banner/public/course/image/featured-card/dynamics-and-control_378x225.jpg?itok=VpiHA92P', 'Engineering', 'edX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'UPValenciaX', '2015-11-24 23:09:30');

What is the religious and political context into which they emerged? How were they first interpreted? How and why do they make such an enormous impact in Christian communities and in politics today? Archaeological materials and ancient writings will help you to enter the ancient Mediterranean world and to think about religious groups, power, poverty, health, and the lives of elites and slaves in the Roman Empire. Weâll explore how immediately controversial these letters were, and how these letters are used today to debate relations between Christians and Jews; issues such as love, law, and grace; and topics such as charismatic Christianity, homosexuality, and womenâs religious leadership. Â  Whether youâve been studying Paulâs letters for years or are merely curious about what Christian scriptures are, this course will provide you with information to deepen your understanding of the ancient contexts and present-day controversies about these texts.

The course follows the MIT on-campus class 8.851 as it was given by Professor Iain Stewart in the Fall of 2013, and includes his video lectures, resource material on various effective theories, and a series of problems to facilitate learning the material. Anyone can register for the online version of the course, and students at MIT or Harvard can also register for 8.S851 for course credit. Effective field theory (EFT) provides a fundamental framework to describe physical systems with quantum field theory. In this course you will learn both how to construct EFTs and how to apply them in a variety of situations. We will cover the majority of the common tools that are used by different effective field theories. In particular: identifying degrees of freedom and symmetries, formulating power counting expansions (both dimensional and non-dimensional), field redefinitions, bottom-up and top-down effective theories, fine-tuned effective theories, matching and Wilson coefficients, reparameterization invariance, and various examples of advanced renormalization group techniques. Examples of effective theories we will cover are the Standard Model as an effective field theory, integrating out the massive W, Z, Higgs, and top, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic effective field theories including those with a large scattering length, static sources and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), and a theory for collider physics, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). Since this is an advanced graduate physics course, you will find that self motivation and interaction with others is essential to learning the material. The purpose of the online course is to set you up with a foundation, to teach you to speak the language of EFT, and to connect you with other students and researchers that are interested in learning or broadening their exposure to this subject. Each week you will complete automatically graded homework problems to test your understanding and to help you master the material. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class, but your online responses must be done individually. To facilitate these interactions there will be a forum for student-to-student discussions, with threads to cover different topics, and moderators with experience in this field. Student learning and discussions will also be prompted by questions posed after each lecture topic. There will be no tests or final exam, but at the end of the course each student will give a 30 minute presentation on an EFT topic of their choosing. The subject of effective field theory is rich and diverse, and far broader than we will be able to cover in a single course. The presentations will create an opportunity for you to learn about additional subjects beyond those in lecture from your fellow students. To facilitate this learning opportunity, each student will be required to watch and grade eight presentations from among their fellow students. Of these eight, you will view 5 presentations that will be chosen for you, and you will view at least 3 more that you choose yourself from among the available topics. Since this is a graduate course we anticipate that learning the subject, and having the 8.EFTx materials available as an online resource will be more valuable to most of you than obtaining a grade. Therefore anyone who registers for the course will be able to retain access to the course materials after the course has ended. Since some of you may find a grade useful, we will compute a grade for everyone by using a combination of homework problems (50%) and your final research presentation project (50%). Â For many of the course elements you may work at your own pace. The presentation project will be due December 16th.Â  For those following the suggested schedule there is a one-week break over the Christmas & New Years holiday, and two homework problems that are due in January.

A wondrously romantic belief is that brilliant thinkers magically produce brilliant ideas: Einstein jostles his hair and relativity falls out. We can enjoy these fanciful visions of leaps of genius, but we should not be fooled into believing that theyâre reality. Brilliant innovators are brilliant because they practice habits of thinking that inevitably carry them step by step to works of genius. No magic and no leaps are involved.

Students can expect to cover the material of a traditional first circuits course with a project-based approach. We start with essential theory and develop an understanding of the building blocks of electronics as we analyze, design, and build different parts of a robot from scratch around a microcontroller. This course uses the Texas Instruments MSP430G2 LaunchPad, but you are welcome to bring whichever development board or microcontroller you like! Useful mathematics will be discussed where appropriate, but only a working knowledge of high school algebra is required to follow along for most of the course.Â The philosophy of the course is to learn by doing, so every lecture features a substantial lab component. Students are invited to work together in small groups to build their own robots along with the instructors. There will also be individual circuit analysis and design exercises to reinforce the theories presented in the course. Those who successfully complete each theory assignment and earn a passing grade will get an Honor Code certificate from BerkeleyX. Additionally, a kit of electronic components will be available from Newark element14 starting June 12. The kit is not necessary to obtain a certificate for this run of the course, but it will greatly enhance your learning experience. Some mechanical components are required to complete the robot as presented in the course. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. Creativity is encouraged! Students who are willing to work outside the bounds of the class to develop their own inventions will get the most out of this guided learning experience. MyDAQ Information Those who do not have access to an oscilloscope or a digital multimeter might consider purchasing a MyDAQ to enable measurements. The video modules use the MyDAQ and the MyProtoBoard as measurement equipment to debug circuits. National Instruments has made available the MyDAQ for students in this course.

Quiz exercises are sprinkled throughout the videos to reinforce your knowledge and every module ends with a problem set that reinforces the design and analysis aspects of the class. Is this class taught at UC Berkeley? This class is part of the laboratory component of "EE40: Introduction to Microelectronic Systems," the first circuit analysis course at UC Berkeley. It was specifically designed for the online course format. What will the robot do? The bare-bones robot that we build will be capable of bouncing around, responding to light or touch inputs, and responding to a loud audio signal. What supplies and equipment will I need to get the most out of this course? In order to download programs to the MSP430 microcontroller, you will need access to a modern operating system (Apple, Windows, or Linux) with the Energia environment (http://energia.nu/download) installed. Additionally, access to some wire cutters and pliers would be useful. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. An oscilloscope would be useful, but not necessary. The NI MyDAQ has been made available for students who would like to follow along with the course. The robot project as presented also requires a few wooden craft sticks and two springs which can be found at a local hardware store. How much does the kit cost? The parts kit will cost around $50 USD for most parts. You are welcome to purchase a kit with another student and to work together on labs to split costs. We will also demonstrate other parts not in the kit for those interested in extending their projects. Will I need to know how to program? Sample programs are provided in each module that will allow you to test your own circuits with an MSP430 LaunchPad controller. These programs will be explained in optional videos for interested students. If you already know how to code, you can tweak these programs to add additional functionality to your project. Will this course cover microcontroller programming? No. Sample programs written in Energia, a high-level language, will be provided, but programming will not be explicitly covered. Students interested in learning microcontroller programming should refer toÂ UT Austinxâs Embedded SystemsÂ course. What if I already have a microcontroller? Since analog electronics are the emphasis of the course, you should feel free to use any microcontroller you feel comfortable with. However, the use of any other microcontrollers would require you to write your own programs. Is there a required textbook? No textbook is required for this course. Handouts are provided for the concepts presented in the class; material for some of these handouts is taken from the 2ndÂ edition of the bookÂ CircuitsÂ by Fawwaz Ulaby and Michel Maharbiz and we recommend the book as way to delve deeper into basic circuit concepts. We also occasionally provide links to web content that we find useful or informative.

Experimental, evocative, and sometimes simply puzzling, electronic literature challenges our assumptions about reading, writing, authorship, and meaning. Yet e-lit, as it is often called, has also profoundly influenced mainstream culture. Literature, film, comics, apps, and video games have all learned lessons from electronic literature. This course will trace the rise of electronic literature and explore both historic and contemporary works of e-lit. Weâll begin with electronic literatureâs roots in avant-garde art and Cold War technology, and follow e-lit through the birth of the personal computer into the era of the Web and smartphone. At every step along the way the expressive power of new mediaâthe way digital media enables and shapes different modes of creative and cultural expressionâwill be of particular interest to us.

(3212, 'Embedded Systems - Shape The World', 'Learn how electronic gadgets are designed, developed, and built as embedded systems that shape the world.', 'Learn how electronic gadgets are designed, developed, and built as embedded systems that shape the world. This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will possess the knowledge to build your own arcade-style game from the ground up. This is the third time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes fromÂ the previous offering of the course. There are 14Â labs, but students can pick and choose seven of them to achieve certification. The three labs that students found most rewarding were the finite state machine traffic light controller, generating sound using a digital to analog convertor, and creating a smart object using Wifi communication. This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems. To complete this course, you will be required to purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state-of-the-art ARM Cortex-M4 processor. We will provide instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software at: http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html. FAQ How will the Spring 2016 course be the same as the course run Spring 2015? This course will be lab-based using the same Texas Instruments Tiva series TM4C123 LaunchPad and the set of extra components. We will continue to use the Keil development system, and students will first develop/test in simulation followed by testing on the real board. 12 of the 14 labs will be essentially the same and two labs will be upgraded. Same as last year, students will need to complete at least seven of the labs on the real board to achieve certification. How will the Spring 2016 course be different from the course run Spring 2015? This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems. Is this class related to a campus course of The University of Texas at Austin? Yes, this course corresponds to the Electrical and Computer Engineering course EE319K Introduction to Embedded Systems, which is a required course offered in the freshman year to all ECE students and some BME students. Is there a textbook associated with this class? The class is based on the textbook Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers ISBN: 978-1477508992. However, the purchase of the textbook is not required. Do I need a Windows PC? Yes, any system running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 will be ok. Furthermore, with a third party virtualization software like Parallels or VMware Fusion, one can install the Windows operating system on a Mac. How much does it cost to take this class? It does not cost anything to take the class. However, since this a lab-based class, there is a lab kit you will purchase. You will also have the option of obtaining an ID Verified certificate for a $50 fee. How much does the kit cost? In the US one can purchase the microcontroller board and parts for about $40 USD plus shipping. There is also an optional graphics display for an additional $10 USD plus shipping. The optional graphics display will make the last lab a lot more fun. The CC3100 Boosterpack costs $20 USD plus shipping and will be required if you wish to complete the Wifi lab. Can I take this course without buying the kit? Yes, there are three approaches to taking this class. Can I use another microcontroller? If you are following approach one, where you are listening to the videos, reading the assignments and playing with the interactive tools, then you can use any microcontroller. However, if you wish to obtain certification, you will need to use the Tiva series TM4C123 so you can interact with the automatic graders. What does it mean for the display to be optional? In the last lab you will build an arcade-style game. We expect most students will connect the microcontroller board to the PC. In this manner the game output can be displayed on a window of the PC. However, for about $10 USD plus shipping, you can order a small Nokia 5110 LCD display so your game can be operated in a stand-alone fashion. Will this course really take 10 hours per week? The first option of just listening, reading and playing with interactive animations will take two or three hours per week. The second option of performing the labs in simulation will take five or six hours per week. The third option of building and testing systems on the real microcontroller will require 10 hours per week. Can I take this course if I have never programmed before? Anyone is allowed register, but we believe to get the maximum benefit you should have prior programming experience at an introductory level. However, this could be your second class involving programming. Can I contact the Instructors or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. Instructors will monitor these forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases responses from other students will be adequate and faster. I really want to take this course, what is next? You should purchase the microcontroller and extra electronics before the start of class.

Pre-tax subsidies, which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy, are high in many emerging and developing economies, and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties, these countries have tax subsidies, where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption, including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences, energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform. This course builds an extensive cross-country analysis, which is reported in the recently published IMF book âEnergy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications,â to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy. In the first part of the course, economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies, and then describe the economic, social, and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first, to review what works best in energy subsidy reform, in light of country experiences globally; and second, to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies. Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country or simply interested in better understanding issues related to energy subsidies, this course will provide hands-on training on the design of successful reforms of energy subsidies.

Energy technology is a highly multidisciplinary subject, which extends from engineering (e.g. mechanical, chemical, civil, environmental and electrical) to economy and ecology. This course is designed for students with limited engineering knowledge. It gives a broad overview of energy technology, mainly focusing on electric power generation. Before introducing technical aspects of power generation, impacts of excessive fossil fuel consumption to the environment, such as global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and emissive pollutants, are addressed. In addition, strategies and challenges of energy security and social justice for resource-poor countries, such as an island region of Taiwan, will be emphasized. The technical topics cover most of the existing and emerging technologies, which include: The students will gain comprehensive knowledge of the above listed energy technologies, in which the working principles, their practical applications and the latest progresses are emphasized. Based on the knowledge learn in the classes, the students will be aware about the pros and cons of these technologies, and be able to make their choices for selecting the most desired energy.

Through the process of evolution, animals have developed their biological features and their cultures based on their surrounding environments. How we live our lives today is a direct result of features developed from our primate ancestors as they adapted to new environments. In primatology, it is essential to think about how cultural development and biological natures are inseparable. This course will help you rediscover the process of evolution and will introduce primatological studies conducted by researchers at Kyoto University, Japan.Â Based on carefully conducted research on primate species, we will explore the origins of human beings and provide you with examples of common similarities between human beings and non-human primates. We will analyze basic features, such as foraging, mating, aggression, and communication from the primatological viewpoint. Furthermore, cultural and social aspects of human society, from the formation of family groups to community activities, will be considered thoroughly, in comparison to those of monkeys and apes. Our goal is to broaden your view of humans to a wider extent and think dynamically about your biology in terms of human evolution. Through acquiring knowledge of basic primatology in this course, you will establish a viewpoint to think and discuss the evolutionary process of human, and human society, in conjunction with those of our close relatives.

How can economic policy help support or restore health to the economy? These questions are at the heart of financial programming. In our FPP courses you will learn the building blocks of how to answer to these questions. Financial programming is a framework to analyze the current state of the economy, forecast where the economy is headed, and identify economic policies that can change the course of the economy. In Part 1 of the FPP sequence, presented by IMF''s Institute for Capacity Development, you will learn the basic skills required to conduct financial programming. The course presents the principal features of the four main sectors that comprise the macroeconomy (real, fiscal, external, and monetary); demonstrates how to read, interpret, and analyze the accounts for these sectors; and illustrates how these sectors are interlinked. (Part 2 of the FPP sequence will cover preparation of a baseline forecast and design of an adjustment program.) During the course, economists from the IMF will lead you through the accounts and analysis of an economy. Besides engaging with lecture videos, you will answer questions on the concepts explained, solve short numerical exercises, discuss with fellow participants economic developments in your country, and work with data for a hypothetical country. The reading material will be provided to you. Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country, a professional working with economic data, or simply interested in better understanding the developments of an economy, this course will provide hands-on training on macroeconomic analysis.

This course explores immunology, how the body defends itself from constant assault by parasites and pathogens. This course will present the fundamentals of both innate and adaptive immunity, emphasizing functional interactions among cells and organs. We will cover signaling, pathogen recognition and the division of labor among myeloid, lymphoid and supporting cells. The subject matter will also supply health professionals and biomedical researchers with the basic vocabulary and concepts necessary to understand both clinical press releases and primary literature.

Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists. Â  In the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm''s law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information. Â  Overall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.

Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. âFuture Citiesâ aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most. The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made âorganismâ with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. âFuture Citiesâ will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space.

Uno de los retos que enfrentan dÃ­a a dÃ­a las instituciones pÃºblicas, organismos no gubernamentales, agencias de desarrollo y otros actores que promueven el desarrollo econÃ³mico y social en AmÃ©rica Latina y el Caribe, es cÃ³mo transformar propuestas en realidades concretas que mejoren el bienestar de la sociedad y logren que estos resultados se obtengan dentro del tiempo y recursosÂ  disponibles. Este curso presenta conceptos y herramientas que pueden ser aplicados en la gestiÃ³n de proyectos y que pueden generar un cambio sustancial para alcanzar los objetivos propuestos. De esta manera, este MOOC se propone fortalecer la capacidad de gestiÃ³n de proyectos de desarrollo en la RegiÃ³n para que sean ejecutados en forma eficiente y efectiva. Este curso incluye casos prÃ¡cticos queÂ  ayudan a comprender los conceptos y herramientas clave para la gestiÃ³n de proyectos, presentaciones de expertos PMP (Project Management Professional) con amplia experiencia en el tema, foros de discusiÃ³n y lecturas seleccionadas.Â  Los contenidos del curso se encuentran alineados con las guÃ­as y estÃ¡ndares de buenas prÃ¡cticas en gestiÃ³n de proyectos presentados en la quinta ediciÃ³n delÂ ProjectÂ  Management Body of KnowledgeÂ (PMBOKÂ®) delÂ Project Management InstituteÂ (PMI). La base conceptual de este curso es la metodologÃ­a PM4R (Project Management for Results) desarrollada por el Instituto Interamericano de Desarrollo EconÃ³mico y Social (INDES) del BID que estÃ¡ acreditado comoÂ Registered Education ProviderÂ (REP) del PMI. La metodologÃ­a PM4R adapta las buenas prÃ¡cticas internacionales a la gestiÃ³n de proyectos de desarrollo. Aunque estas buenas prÃ¡cticas han estado presentes durante muchos aÃ±os en los proyectos corporativos privados, en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os el BID ha estado liderando el proceso de su incorporaciÃ³n progresiva en el sector pÃºblico y en los proyectos de desarrollo, contribuyendo a la construcciÃ³n de realidades que mejoran vidas. Â  Si tienes alguna pregunta, escrÃ­benos aÂ idbx@iadb.org La preparaciÃ³n de este cursoÂ  fue financiada por el Fondo de Fortalecimiento de la Capacidad Institucional (ICSF), gracias al aporte del Gobierno de la RepÃºblica Popular de China.Â Â  Â  Public institutions, non-governmental organizations, development agencies, and others who promote economic and social development in Latin America and the Caribbean often struggle to turn proposals into concrete realities that increase social well-being and achieve results within the available time with scarce resources. This course provides concepts and tools to apply in project management that can generate a substantial change in the way objectives are being met. This MOOC seeks to strengthen participantsÂ´ capacities in project management for development so that projects can be effectively and efficiently executed. This project management MOOC includes case studies that will help you better understand key project management concepts and tools; presentations from PMP experts with ample experience in project management for development; discussion forums; and selected readings. Contents are aligned with guidelines and project management best practices presented in the Project Management InstituteÂ´s (PMI) fifth edition Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOKÂ®).Â  The Project Management for Results (PM4R) methodology, developed by IDBÂ´s Inter-American Institute for Economic and Social Development (INDES), serves as a conceptual base for this course. INDES is a PMI Registered Education Provider and its PM4R methodology adapts international best practices to development projects. Although these best practices have been present for many years in corporate projects, the IDB has led its progressive inclusion in the public sector and in development projects, contributing to the construction of realities that improve lives.

It develops a toolkit of interdisciplinary analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. Four physician-anthropologists - Paul Farmer, Arthur Kleinman, Anne Becker, and Salmaan Keshavjee - draw on experience working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas to investigate what the field of global health comprises, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in both expected and unexpected ways. The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles: A global awareness. This course aims to enable learners to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and well being. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities. A foundation in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels. An ethical engagement. Throughout the course, learners will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Learners will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities. A sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could all too easily engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, learners will observe that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the worldâs poorest and suffering people.

Homerâs account of the Trojan War in theÂ IliadÂ explores the effects of warfareÂ upon Greeks and Trojans alike. It illustrates not only the challenges that theÂ combatants faced, but also the plight of innocent victimsâ women, children, and the elderly. Though theÂ IliadÂ is often regarded as a kind of Greek national epic, Homer is remarkably even-handed in his treatment of the two sides, even seeming to favor the Trojans over the Greeks at times. He repeatedly emphasizes the horrors of war and his varied descriptionsÂ of deaths on the battlefield are unparalleled in both intensity and, paradoxically,Â poetic charm. The primary objective of warfare in the imaginary time period depicted by Homer is to attain personal glory through acts of individual prowess, with the good of the community seen as a secondary goal. Â  This course explores the idea that war is both universal and particular. The Vietnam War was not the same as the Iraq War. In every war, some things are the same, while some are different.

Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health''s classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study. HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Or have you started a novel draft only to find your interest or confidence waning? In this course, the international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbiaâs renowned MFAÂ program introduce the essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts.Â  While ideas and inspiration are often enough to ignite interest in writing a novel, writers can quickly lose confidence, especially when their best efforts have inadvertently produced flat characters, waning conflicts, tangled plots and weak dialogue. Reaching your goal of writing (and perhaps, publishing) a novel requires an understanding of fictionâs deeper mechanics and a familiarity with the specific craft elements that will help translate your creativity and imagination into compelling paragraphs, scenes and chapters. Through writing exercises aimed at developing new skills, concrete examples from published novels, feedback and discussion with fellow writers and opportunities to identify and strengthen weaknesses in their own projects, learners will broaden their knowledge of fiction craft as they explore creating memorable characters, the art of scene design, tactics for managing unwieldy plots and steps for writing layered and meaningful dialogue. Whether youâre beginning your novel draft or nearing the end, this course is a unique opportunity to learn the essentials of strong fiction writing from award-winning authors sharingÂ their proven methods and approaches. The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, those participating in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has a novel in progress. FAQ Do I need to complete Part 1: Planning and Outlining to take this course? No. As long as you are in the process of writing a novel, this course will be valuable to you.

Outlining is a crucial step in the novel writing process, one that fuels creativity and prepares the writer to stay on track and avoid common pitfalls. Through hands-on weekly exercises with a focus on craft and process, as well as insights from the real-world practices of accomplished authors, this course explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline. You will learn the fundamentals of character development, world-building and the basics of storytelling architecture. You''ll work intensively on your own creative project and hone your outline through feedback and discussion with fellow writers.

The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, participants in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has ever dreamed of writing a novel. FAQ Do I need to have started a novel to take this course? No. However, you should have one or more novel ideas that you wish to work on during this course.

If you have already started a novel, or are having issues with a partially finished manuscript without an outline, this course can help you clarify your intentions and work out structural issues. We believe the process of outlining helps writers understand a work in progress in a way that simply âwriting throughâ cannot. Is this course related to an existing UBC writing class?

If you are unable to access Youtube, the introductory video is available via XuetangX. We make ethical or behaviour guiding right / wrong judgments all the time but have you ever wondered where Ethics comes from, what it is about and why it is important? This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.Â  Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law â in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward â to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor â a natural dÃ o. We will look at two rival directions this natural dÃ o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the dÃ o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance â Medieval Chinese Buddhism. Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.

Â You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data. Â Statistics can be confusing and opaque. Â Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengagedâeven fearful and resentful. But in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about itâfrom news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information? Â One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking. Â  The purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approachâyou will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.

The U.S. incarcerates a larger number and percentage of its own citizens than any nation on earth: larger than China, Russia, Cuba, or Iran. American ex-offenders are arrested again at a rate of 67% within three years, and 75% within five years of release.

Este curso â el primero de una serie de cursos sobre este tema - da respuesta a las anteriores preguntas y, a modo de introducciÃ³n, brinda el marco conceptual de la gestiÃ³n para resultados en el desarrollo con Ã©nfasis en los gobiernos subnacionales. En los siguientes cursos de esta serie profundizaremos en cada uno de los componentes del ciclo de gestiÃ³n pÃºblica. Los paÃ­ses de AmÃ©rica Latina y el Caribe enfrentan considerables desafÃ­os de la gestiÃ³n pÃºblica, tales como el diseÃ±o de polÃ­ticas pÃºblicas que tengan en consideraciÃ³n los puntos de vista de los diferentes actores; las demandas ciudadanas y los escasos recursos disponibles; la asignaciÃ³n de los recursos financieros; la calidad de los servicios pÃºblicos o el seguimiento y la evaluaciÃ³n de la gestiÃ³n, entre otros. La gestiÃ³n para resultados en el desarrollo y su enfoque de gerencia contribuyen al abordaje de estos desafÃ­os mediante el tratamiento integral de las distintas etapas del ciclo de la gestiÃ³n pÃºblica, el uso de la informaciÃ³n para la toma de decisiones y el empleo de mÃºltiples instrumentos y metodologÃ­as.

What are the components of the public management cycle associated with managing for development results? What are the main challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean for the implementation of managing for development results? How to assist the implementation of managing for development results in Latin America and the Caribbean? This course â the first of a series of courses in this topic â answers the previous questions and, as an introduction, provides a conceptual framework on managing for development results with special emphasis in subnational governments. In the following courses of this series we will go in depth in each one of the components of the public management cycle. Latin American and Caribbean countries face considerable challenges in public management, such as the design of public policies that take into account different stakeholdersâ points of view; citizen demands and scarce available resources; financial resource allocation; public service quality; and monitoring and evaluation; among others. Managing for development results and its managerial focus contributes to addressing these challenges through a comprehensive effort involving different stages of the public management cycle, the use of information for decision-making, and the use of multiple instruments and methodologies.

How are organs built? How is the body imaged? How do you design an aircraft? How do electrons travel in micro and nanoelectronics? How are drugs delivered in the body? How do you build on soils that are unstable? How do robots see? How is light used in devices? How is data stored and managed? How is pollution mitigated? How are electrical signals processed? How are strong and tough materials designed and built? How is thermal energy managed? How is data transmitted? How are systems integrated? How do you make sure goods and services reach their destination? How do you start a company? What are the underlying ethical and social responsibilities of being a professional engineer?

Rattan and Nathan W. Klingbeil. Publisher: John Wiley and Sons, ISBN:978-1-118-14180-9. Â  Topics to be covered in mathematics will include: application of algebra in engineering in linear and quadratic equations, trigonometry in motion of robots, application of complex numbers in electrical circuits, use of systems of equations to solve problems in statics, dynamics and DC circuits. Concepts of derivatives will be introduced and its application in engineering problems such as dynamics, electrical circuits and mechanics will be explored. In a similar fashion concepts of integrals will be examined in the context of engineering applications such as statics, dynamics and electrical circuits. The intent of this course is not to establish mastery of mathematics but rather develop an understanding of the role played by mathematics to help solve engineering problems.

While the specific language isn''t all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.

Sociology offers us a powerful set of tools with which to interpret our relationship to a global social and cultural economy. This course extends conventional sociology to foster an understanding of how the conditions of our everyday lives fit in with broader trends of continuity and change in regions across the world. We use the global garment industry as a vehicle for mobilizing our sociological imaginations, and follow the movements of capital, materials, and labor in the garment industry to examine the economic and cultural exchanges that keep our complex world in motion. Along the way, weâll learn to critically read social scientific texts and construct evidence-based arguments. Klaus Lanstein, Group of People Walking Over World Map. Courtesy Getty Images.

Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years.

The concept of a Smart City holds much promise for improving the quality of life for city dwellers, but what exactly do we mean by âSmart City?â It means aligning information technologies to citizensâ needs in order to enhance their day-to-day lives by increasing efficiency, lowering costs, and engaging more directly with city dwellers. Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system. Since a city canÂ´t be visualized in only one perspective, this course tackles some of its individual sectors to obtain theÂ key performance indicators that are essential to improvingÂ the quality of life, including: urbanization, communication, education, and economy. Quantifying that data is useful for estimating consumed resources, forecasting shortages, and correcting damage in a timely manner.

The first is to introduce you to the things that philosophers think about. We will look at some perennial philosophical problems: Is there a God? What is knowledge, and how do we get it? What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world? Do we have free will? How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits change? The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures. If you wish to take the course as a ''verified'' student (technological checks guarantee it is you taking the course) then please register as Verified below. It will cost you $50.

The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions. Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable. The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research. Can I still register after the start date? You can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due. How long does this course last? The course starts on Tuesday, February 3, 2015 and ends on the due date of the final exam, on Thursday, May 26, 2015. What is the format of the class? The course material is organized along units that are aligned with the chapters of the textbook. Each unit contains between one and three lecture sequences. Each lecture sequence consists of short video clips, interleaved with short problems to test your understanding. Each unit also contains a wealth of supplementary material, including videos that go through the solution of various problems. What textbook do I need for the course? None - there is no required textbook. The class follows closely the text Introduction to Probability, 2nd edition, by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, Athena Scientific, 2008; see the publisher''s website or Amazon.com for more information. However, while this textbook is recommended, the materials provided by this course are self-contained. Do I need to watch the lectures live? Video lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your own convenience. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates. Will the text of the video clips be available? Yes, we will provide transcripts of all clips (lectures, worked problems, etc.) that are synched to the videos. How are grades assigned? Grades (Pass or Not Pass) are based on a combination of scores on the weekly homework assignments (11 total), two midterm exams, and a final exam. How much do I need to work for this class? This is an ambitious class in that it covers a lot of material in substantial depth. Furthermore, the only way of mastering the subject is by actually solving on your own a fair number of problems. MIT students who take the corresponding residential class typically report an average of 11-12 hours spent each week, including lectures, recitations, readings, homework, and exams.

Methods will be illustrated with data from a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities. There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population? Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem. The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points," or, "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...," then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl''s school science project (seriously â she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen "just by chance"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course. We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.

(3427, 'Lean Data Approaches to Measure Social Impact', 'Those trying to create social change often revisit a familiar question: how do we know what works?', 'Those trying to create social change often revisit a familiar question: how do we know what works? This simple question can be alarmingly tough to answer; especially when the change we are targeting is complex and multi causal. If we''re to have any hope of answering such questions it is critical that we collect data about our social impact. Such data allows us to learn and to improve our performance against our social targets over time. Lacking this reliable and timely data, a social not-for-profit, investor or business may be left hoping rather than knowing that they''ve improved the lives of their customers.  Of course social professionals of all stripes have been working for years to monitor and evaluate the impact of social programs, products and services. But the timeline for gaining actionable insights to figure out how to achieve the greatest impact has often been too slow, especially for social businesses. If start-ups and tech companies can use principles of agile development to gain customer insights, can social enterprises serving the poor also leverage emerging tools and âlean" design principles to measure impact and shorten learning cycles? Can we build data collection into decision making to improve impact in real time instead of just proving impact years after the fact?  In the last ten years, the infrastructure that allows us to connect to end customers â even end customers living on just a few dollars a day â has improved dramatically. The proliferation of mobile phones and a host of technologies both new (like SMS surveying) and old (such as call-centers) make it easier to collect data from the end customers we aim to serve. Innovative survey questionnaires like the Progress out of Poverty Index developed by the Grameen Foundation allow us to gather robust data without having to ask customers hundreds of questions. And data collection can be integrated into existing company-customer touch points, whether through mobile phones or an in person sales team, making it considerably less onerous.  Acumen''s Lean Data Initiative capitalizes on these important developments, putting decision-making tools in the hands of social enterprises that want to gather real-time data directly from customers. This impact measurement approach is uniquely suited to social investors and the enterprises they support, both of which face the dual pressures of time and cash constraints but still need real data to know that they are delivering on their social, and financial, objectives. And, even if you''re working for neither of these types of organizations and are just interested in uncovering new ways to understand social impact, we believe that the principles and tools that underline the Lean Data approach will help you learn faster and position you to make decisions that maximize your impact to better serve your stakeholders.  In this 7 hour course from Acumen, you''ll learn more about the Lean Data mindset and be introduced to the tools and methods we use. You will scope your own Lean Data Initiative, beginning with mapping the current information flow within your enterprise and pinpointing places where data could be collected in the least disruptive way.

In this offering of the course, we have provided an additional module focused exclusively on entrepreneurship for those who are interested in bringing their solution to fruition. The themes to be addressed are: Global Health Challenges. Mobile Health Opportunities. Entrepreneurship in Health Care. Today, more people have access to a mobile phone than to clean drinking water. At the same time, health systems around the world struggle to deliver cost-effective care. For example, where the United States confronts unsustainably soaring costs and millions of underserved citizens, Sub-Saharan Africa endeavours to provide medical care in the context of infrastructural challenges, economic shortfalls, and the highest disease burden in the world. Throughout India and China, investments in mobile entrepreneurship are reshaping how health care is delivered to massive populations. Meanwhile South America is experiencing a surge of entrepreneurial activity that promises to reshape how its citizens interact with the health system. To expose you to the breadth of activity and opportunity, each class will consist of multiple short presentations from renowned experts. Class discussions about these presentations will also take place online. In the era of expansive and ever-expanding access to mobile technology, ideas can be more readily shared and solutions can more readily reach patients in need, wherever they are. We are more connected than ever before, in many ways: through global dissemination of infectious diseases; through shared challenges such as chronic disease burden; and of course through the Internet and telecom networks. Mobile Health Without Borders aims to realize that promise by providing a platform for participants to increase their capacity to have a meaningful impact on global health. To achieve this, students will work closely with classmates from around the world on small group assignments to prepare for the Health Innovation Challenge: an opportunity to work with a global multi-disciplinary team and world-class mentors to design a solution to a health challenge you care about.

This is a question increasingly asked by forward-thinking leaders in the social sector. Yet, while there is growing buzz around the need to scale solutions, there are limited frameworks or practical roadmaps to help social enterprises get there. How do you identify your core strengths and build upon them strategically? How do you grow in diverse and hard-to-reach markets? How do you avoid racing forward in an unfocused, and ultimately self-defeating, way? How do you achieve "good scale" and steer clear of "bad scale"? Enter the "Repeatable ModelÂ®". The Repeatable ModelsÂ® framework has been developed by Bain & Company based on its experience working with high-performing companies across a range of industries and countries for decades. This experience has helped Bain identify what is required for companies to sustain their success over time. In this course, we''ll show you how to apply this framework to the social sector to scale your work strategically across villages, regions and countries. Drawing from a report co-authored by Acumen and Bain called "Growing Prosperity: Developing Repeatable ModelsÂ® to Scale," this course will present practical advice and case studies from the founders and leaders of social ventures like One Acre Fund and Juhudi Kilimo who have successfully implemented Repeatable ModelsÂ®. By the end of this 2.5 hour course, you''ll have completed a diagnostic tool for your own enterprise and developed a plan for how to continuously implement your core services as you expand.

We often have a vision of the right policies or strategies for improving health, safety, and economic well-being. However, the real problem is getting things done. Even a simple policy intervention such as child vaccination requires much more than nurses and a stock of vaccine to be effective. Case studies are a vital tool for sharing insight about the hows of policy implementation and institutional reform. They trace the steps taken to produce results. They show solutions people have devised to address anticipated challenges and overcome unanticipated obstacles.
